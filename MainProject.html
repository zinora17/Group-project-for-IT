      <h2 style="text-align:center"> THE GRAND VIETNAM RACE </h3>
	<p> Inspired by the classic game Snakes & Ladders and the infamous Mario Party, we decided to make a game called The Grand Vietnam Race. However, instead of using the normal board, the theme chosen was as if the player was travelling around Vietnam from South to North. The gameplay is selectively based on multiple party games, and we will try to work around those to the best of our abilities. </p>
    	<h3><b>Topic: </b></h3>

	<img src="Viet.png" class="center">
	<p>As proposed for this project, we decided to make a game called “The Grand Vietnam" race. Inspired by the popular Mario Party game series, this game is a dice-rolling race game (a race game but you move by rolling dice) in which the players can have items during the race to boost themselves or to sabotage the opponents. The map, on which the race would take place, would be themed by Viet Nam map, and the racers – players – would be travelling from South to North of Viet Nam.</p>
	<p>In terms of gamerules, there are no such complicated orders or restrictions that players must follow. In fact, all they need to do is roll dice and let the RNG (Random Number Generator) decide their destiny. To add more fun and competition aspect to the game, there are also items – which can be used for self-boost or to sabotage the opponents  – and minigames where players compete each other for rewards (inspired by Mario Party series).</p>
	<p>To emphasize our country Viet Nam, the main theme of our game, we added many interesting features into the game. That includes:</p>
	<p>- Images or pieces of art of well-known landscape or viewpoints are displayed on the map.</p>
	<p>- Quizzes and facts about Viet Nam’s cities. This encourage players to learn more about Viet Nam.</p>
	<p>- “Speciality weather” of the area on the map: gives players effects or certain difficulties.</p>

	<h3><b>Motivation: </b></h3>
	<p>Video games have always been one of the most popular forms of entertainment for over 50 years at this point. During this time, there were hundreds of different genres made and perfected such as platformers, 2D and 3D shooters, sports games, dancing games, paint studio games, etc. Noticeably, board-game video games had held the strongest rise amongst them all. However, due to the advancement of technology and human’s minds, people are getting more interested in real experience games like First-person Shooter (FPS), Action-oriented Role-playing Games (ARPG), Virtual Reality (VR) games… and that resulted in a downfall in board-game video games industry.</p>
	<p>After some research, we found the reasons behind the fall of board-game video games. There are many, yet we concluded that only two are significant. Firstly, some gamerules nowadays are getting overly complicated, making it difficult for players to understand how the game actually works. Secondly, all board-game video games in recent time are all based on fantasy themes, which no longer has gamers attention or affection like it used to do.</p>
	<p>On the other hand, we also found that dice-rolling (RNG) based games and Role-playing Games (RPG) still had fondness from gamers all over the world. As big fans of video games, we thought it would be very interesting to make a game with these two categories to bring the board-game video game genre back into the trend.</p>
	
	<h3><b>Landscape: </b></h3>
	<p>As mentioned above, the board-game video games industry was a very competitive platform. There had been so many games that had succeeded and made their brand well-known around the world. Some now are still popular and have tremendous counts of installations like Mario Party, Monopoly and Uno. Thus, many and many ideas had already been implemented, so in order to make something notable and innovative, we had to find distinctive ways to approach the market, think outside of the box, somewhere no one had been before.</p>
	<p>That was when we came to the idea of using our country Viet Nam, the country that is currently on top of the most popular country for tourists, as a theme. This idea, our game, not just implemented most of the essence of board games (simple game rules, dice-rolling, role-playing) but implemented those in a unique way that we believe no one had ever seen before – we made it based on our country. Every feature of this game will be an introduction to Viet Nam. Each item in the game, quiz, event happens during the race, … are all taken from Viet Nam culture. This will attract players that have curiosity about our country and will act as the main aspect for the dominance of our game in the industry, not to mention the simple overall design and gameplay.</p>
